Version 0.3.1 - changed the name of the parameter ntree to num.trees


Version 0.3.0 - round adjusted agreement and mean adjusted agreement to 2 digits
              - speed up meanAdjAgree function 
              - changed that relations to variables not used as primary plit are set as NA (before it was 0)
              - renamed var.relations.corr to var.relations.mfi (as named in the paper)
              - bugfix for MFI and MIR
              - permutation approach to determine p-values was optimized for the selection of important and related variables
              - default approach for p-value calculation was set to "permutation"

Version 0.2.1 - included possibility to analyze categorical variables 

Version 0.2.0 - added function var.sel.mir to select important variables based on mutual impurity reduction
              - added function var.relations.corr to calculate unbiased relations
              - added multicore calculation of variable relations 
              - expand function inputs for var.relations 
              - included possibility to only calculate relations and not select related variables for var.relations function 
              - included the possibility to set case weights

Version 0.1.10 - fixed bug not including first and last surrogate
	       - added random selection of surrogates when adj_agree are the same
	       - fixed bug in var.relation example
	       - added build.clusters function to obtain variable groups  

Version 0.1.9	- some specifics to set s in var.select.smd were adapted
		- added save.memory parameter (to build the forest with ranger) to 	var.select.smd and var.select.md  

Version 0.1.8	- MD now executes var.select.smd with s = 0 instead of using a separate function
		- The function reduce.surrogates is included. 
		- Included parameters create.forest and forest to use var.select.smd for 			  existing forests (e.g. created by reduce.surrogates)
		- Changed the value "trees" to "forest" containing trees and variable names 
		- The C-code is updated to enable multicore analysis

Version 0.1.7	- Included parameter save.ranger in var.select.md and var.select.smd to save 			  ranger object

Version 0.1.6	- Adapted threshold for low depth trees in var.select.smd

Version 0.1.5 	- Added s as value in var.select.smd 
		- Implemented survival function for var.select.smd and var.select.md

Version 0.1.4 	- All errors and comments from coauthors implemented: first version uploaded on 		  github
