\title{Reduce surrogate variables in a random forest.}
\usage{
reduce.surrogates(forest, s = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{a list containing allvariables and trees. Allvariables is a vector of all variable names in the original data set (strings). Trees is a list of trees that was generated by getTreeranger, addLayer, and getSurrogates functions.}

\item{s}{number of surrogate variables in the new forest (have to be less than in the RF in trees)}
}
\value{
forest with s surrogate variables.
}
\description{
This function can be applied to reduce the surrogate variables in a forest that is created by getTreeranger, addLayer
and getSurrogates functions. Hence, it can be applied to the forests that were used for surrogate minimal depth variable importance.
}
\examples{
# read data
data("SMD_example_data")

###### use result of SMD variable importance and reduce surrogate variables to 10
# select variables with smd variable importance (usually more trees are needed)
