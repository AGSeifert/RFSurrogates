\description{
A dataset containing 100 individuals (rows), 1 dependent variable (first column, y), and 200 additional variables (columns 2 to 201):
For the simulation of the 200 additional variables nine variables X1,â€¦,X9 called basic variables were simulated. X1 to X6 are causal
with constant effect sizes of 1 and X7 to X9 are noncausal with effect size of 0. The outcome y is a linear combination of the causal
predictor variables and a normally distributed error term. All basic variables were sampled from a normal distribution
(N(0,1)) just like the noise (N(0,0.2)). For each of the six basic variables X1, X2, X3, X7, X8, and X9 ten variables
with predefined correlations of 0.9 for X1 and X7, 0.6 for X2 and X8, and 0.3 for X3 and X9 were obtained by \code{\link[WGCNA:simulateModule]{WGCNA::simulateModule()}} of
the R package WGCNA. The ten variables of each basis variable are labeled: Cp_basicvariable_number. Additional non-correlated and
independent predictor variables (cgn) were simulated using the standard normal distribution to reach a total number of 200 variables.
