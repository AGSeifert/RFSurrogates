    desc: >
      Surrogate Minimal Depth (SMD) enables the identification of multiple
      features from the same metabolites and reveals meaningful biological
      relations, proving its high potential for the comprehensive utilization
      of high-dimensional metabolomics data.

  - title: Mutual Impact of Features
    desc: >
      Mutual forest impact (MFI) is a relation parameter that evaluates the
      mutual association of the featurs to the outcome and, hence, goes beyond
      the analysis of correlation coefficients. Mutual impurity reduction (MIR)
      is an importance measure that combines this relation parameter with the
      importance of the individual features.
